# Wotch

A p2p video indexing platform. Create a list of videos from any platform like Youtube, Rumble etc and show them as one unified list. Clicking video thumbnails will take you to appropriate site. To work around platform censorship we recommend hosting videos at multiple locations and using Wotch to show one clean feed of videos.

Install npm modules with `npm i` and install all the GX modules with `gx i`

To load up the app in development mode run `npm run web` and finally run `npm run build` to build it for release.
